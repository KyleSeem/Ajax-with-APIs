I am able to get this working with Ajax for the create form, but I can't seem to get the other two forms working. At this time, the ajax for those is turned off and I am using redirect in my server.py script. I'm pretty sure it has to do with the way(ways) I am calling the id - I've tried several different ways and each produces an errored outcome. On many occasions, I recieve different outcomes with no code change. I have spent WAY too long on this assignment and need to move forward with the curriculum, so I am submitting this in it's incomplete format.
